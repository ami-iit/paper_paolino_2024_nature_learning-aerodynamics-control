# Aerodynamic Controllers

In this directory there are the _Aerodynamic-aware Momentum-based Controllers_ described in the article, together with the _Aerodynamic Whole-body Simulator_ necessary to test them.

In [whole-body-aerodynamics-flight](./whole-body-aerodynamics-flight/) there is the Simulink model to perform flight simulations with iRonCub-Mk1, testing the aerodynamic controller whose settings can be changed in [initMomentumBasedFlight.m](./whole-body-aerodynamics-flight/initMomentumBasedFlight.m)

In [whole-body-aerodynamics-balancing](./whole-body-aerodynamics-balancing/) there is the Simulink model to test the aerodynamic controller on the real robot with ground balancing experiments.
