# Aerodynamic Models

In [Deep Neural Network](./deep-neural-network/) there are the Python scripts to reproduce the training procedure performed on the Nvidia RTX A4500 GPU (16GB VRAM) as reported in the article, along with te dataset  `.mat` file used to store the data acquired via CFD simulations on the robot in freestram conditions.
