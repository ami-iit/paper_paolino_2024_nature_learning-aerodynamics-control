# CFD-simulations

This directory concerns the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations performed using _steady incompressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes_ equations with the _Realizable_ $k-\varepsilon$ and _Shear-Stress Transport (SST)_ $k-\omega$ turbulence models, along with the settings reported in the article.

- In [simplified-cad-models](./simplified-cad-models/) there are the SpaceClaim simplified CAD model of iRonCub-Mk1 and a SpaceClaim script to automatically update the geometry of the robot according to an assigned joints configuration.

- In [results/wind-tunnel-setup](./results/wind-tunnel-setup/) the results of the aerodynamic force areas are reported for different joint configurations of the rebot, for the simulations conducted with the wind tunnel setup model.
